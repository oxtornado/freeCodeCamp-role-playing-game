# RPG Game - FreeCodeCamp Certification Project

This project was developed as part of the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification from FreeCodeCamp. It is a simple role-playing game implemented in JavaScript using control structures such as `while`, `for`, `if`, ternary operators, and DOM manipulation.

## Project Features
- Game logic implemented with control structures.
- User interaction through the DOM.
- Use of ternary operators to simplify decisions.
- Game flow controlled with loops and conditionals.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript** (algorithms and DOM manipulation)
- **HTML** (game structure)
- **CSS** (basic styles for the interface)

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rpg-game.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Follow the game instructions and enjoy.

## Screenshots
_(Optional: Add screenshots of the game in action)_

## Future Improvements
- Implementation of enemies with basic AI.
